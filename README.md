# ReInitOS
Operating system development project by [The Routinely Interrupts](https://theroutinelyinterrupts.substack.com/).

## Build
 - Building requires a cross compiler, we are using GCC version 13.2.0 and Binutils version 2.41 with the x86_64-elf target (if you need help building one [this page on OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) may be of some help).
